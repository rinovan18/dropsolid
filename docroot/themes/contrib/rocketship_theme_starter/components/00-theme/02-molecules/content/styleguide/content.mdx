# Content

This is a generic block, that reuses the Paragraph reference field to show various Paragraphs instead of loose fields.<br />
It is recommended to avoid using it, as it is handy to quickly produce demo content on the home page,<br />
but is a pain to style and keep the content editor from breaking the layout<br />

First of all, you need to style the block by ID instead of block type and context, which is bad practice,<br />
and secondaly, you always need to override some default Paragraph styling (because it was originally meant for content in content types).

So use at your own risk.

Preferably, you would replace any 'content' blocks with a new custom block type that matches whatever functionality you are trying to add.<br />
And replace the paragraph reference field with individual fields.
