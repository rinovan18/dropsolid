## Layout Builder Layout Templates

Because our 'real' templates are part of the Rocketship Core module, and how complexly nested it is, it is very difficult to reuse them in Storybook. <br />
For this reason, we opted to recreate them as static Styleguide components.<br />
Since the templates from Core should not change in a project, it is fairly safe to use the static ones as an analog.<br />

### Data structure

As always, take a look at the yml files in these styleguide components for usage.

Label, variant, modifier are all used to build BEM classes <br />
`extra_classes` is used to print (you guessed it) extra classes<br />
`settings` contain extra options, like reversing stuff in the html
the regions inside `content` needs to be set to true if you want to output anything into those regions
`region_type` is only useful on the full Page node, not for layouts used in nested stuff like teasers

```
label: 'Rocketship 2-col'
variant: 'rs-two-col'
region_type: 'content'
modifier: null
extra_classes: 'home__section home__section--usp-info'
settings:
  layout_reversed: false
content:
  first_main: true
  second_main: true
```


## Notes

- Some data in Storybook embedded templates doesn't reset the next time the template is used<br />
  This means we need to reset it before usage or old and new data will merge (when the merge-filer is used to initialize those variables).<br />
  The most annoying example so far, is the layout templates<br />
  You can see the Styleguide component for blog teaser (Feature molecules) for an example on this.
  ```
  {% set bem_section_modifier = [] %}
  {% set bem_section_extra = [] %}
  {% set modifier = false %}
  {% set bem_region_modifier = [] %}
  {% set bem_region_extra = [] %}
  ```
